Follower-Watchdog-Controller.c

This program shows the software in C for a system that I completed for my Senior Design project at Oklahoma State. This program ran on a Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC), the PIC2580. I specifcally wrote the code for lines 9 - 298 with all method's labeled as "Chad's method and code" in the comments.
This code indicates to the main platform that the user wants to operate in "Watchdog" or "Follower" mode based on the switch input.
Each mode results in different LED outputs for the user to know the current mode while IR signal outputs and XBEE outputs communicate with the main platform.
